    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "En esta última variante de TinyGPT se mantiene la estructura general del modelo, incluidas las capas MoE y la cantidad de expertos, pero se modifica de manera puntual y significativa la arquitectura interna de cada experto. Este cambio hace que el MoE ya no funcione como un conjunto de expertos idénticos, sino como un módulo heterogéneo donde cada experto tiene una capacidad distinta para transformar representaciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Esto genera varios efectos observables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mayor diversidad funcional entre expertos  \n",
    "Al no compartir ya la misma arquitectura, es más probable que cada experto aprenda transformaciones diferentes. Aunque no existe garantía de especialización fuerte en un modelo pequeño, sí aparece una mayor diversificación en las activaciones internas, lo que hace al MoE menos redundante que en versiones anteriores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mejor aprovechamiento del gating  \n",
    "El gating sigue siendo el mismo, pero ahora tiene algo real que elegir. Antes todos los expertos producían funciones muy parecidas entre sí. Ahora al ser arquitecturalmente distintos, el gating puede asignar tokens según qué experto resulte más útil para cada caso. Ese cambio hace que la mezcla experta ya no sea puramente simétrica y uniforme, sino más dinámica.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ligeras mejoras en estabilidad y calidad de la representación  \n",
    "Sin modificar la cantidad de parámetros de manera explosiva, la mayor capacidad interna de los expertos permite:\n",
    "    - Reducir un poco la redundancia del MoE\n",
    "    - Generar salidas con más variabilidad\n",
    "    - Suavizar ciertos patrones repetitivos\n",
    "    - Otorgar un pequeño margen de mejora en la pérdida durante el entrenamiento.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comportamiento de generación más flexible  \n",
    "Las funciones de sampling (greedy, temperature, top-k, top-p) muestran resultados algo más ricos, especialmente con top-k y top-p. No porque el modelo sea mucho más grande, sino porque el MoE aporta rutas de cómputo no uniformes, lo que aumenta la diversidad interna del modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Un MoE conceptualmente más realista  \n",
    "Aunque sigue siendo TinyGPT, esta versión es la que más se aproxima a un MoE como se usa en modelos modernos: expertos heterogéneos + gating compartido. La mezcla resulta más expresiva y menos redundante, lo que era una limitación clara en las versiones anteriores."
