    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "En esta segunda versión del proyecto se incorporó el tokenizer tiktoken (BPE al estilo GPT-2), reemplazando la tokenización carácter-level de la primera implementación. Esta modificación introdujo mejoras significativas en el comportamiento del modelo y permitió evaluar con más claridad el impacto del preprocesamiento en la calidad de los modelos autoregresivos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los resultados obtenidos permiten extraer las siguientes conclusiones principales:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. El cambio de tokenizer genera una mejora clara en la calidad del modelo.  \n",
    "En comparación con la primera versión, que operaba a nivel de caracteres, el uso de un tokenizer subword reduce la longitud efectiva de las secuencias y produce representaciones más informativas. Como resultado, el modelo aprende más rápidamente, converge de forma más estable y genera texto más coherente.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. La arquitectura base (TinyGPT) mantiene sus limitaciones, pero se vuelve más expresiva.  \n",
    "Aunque el tamaño del modelo sigue siendo reducido, la interacción con tokens más semánticos permite que TinyGPT capture mejor la estructura de palabras y secuencias, superando varias de las limitaciones observadas en la primera versión. El modelo ya no depende de aprender patrones de caracteres repetitivos y logra relaciones más largas dentro de las frases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Los métodos de decodificación muestran mejoras más notables en esta versión.  \n",
    "En la versión con caracteres, top-k y top-p ayudaban a evitar repeticiones, pero la calidad seguía siendo pobre. Con tiktoken, estas mismas técnicas producen resultados más variados y coherentes, porque parten de distribuciones más informativas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. La integración con Mixture of Experts (MoE) funciona mejor con un tokenizer subword.  \n",
    "En la primera versión, los expertos tendían a especializarse de forma irregular debido a la pobre señal lingüística del modelo. En esta segunda versión, cada experto recibe entradas más ricas, y el gating puede distribuir tokens de manera más significativa. Esto mejora la utilidad práctica de MoE aun en un modelo pequeño.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Persisten las diferencias de escala respecto a modelos reales.  \n",
    "A pesar de las mejoras, TinyGPT sigue siendo un modelo pequeño, limitado en capacidad y entrenado sobre un corpus reducido. Sin embargo, esta versión demuestra de forma más clara el comportamiento típico de la familia GPT y permite visualizar con mayor precisión los beneficios de un tokenizer moderno.\n",
    "\n",
    "En conjunto, la comparación entre ambas versiones evidencia que el mayor salto de calidad no proviene de ampliar la arquitectura, sino de usar un tokenizer adecuado. La segunda versión ofrece un pipeline más cercano al de los LLM reales, mejora la generación, estabiliza el entrenamiento y potencia el uso de MoE, demostrando la importancia crítica de la tokenización en modelos autoregresivos."
