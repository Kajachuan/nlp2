        "# Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Los nuevos mapas de atención muestran patrones mucho más nítidos debido a que, con tiktoken, las secuencias pasaron a ser más cortas, reduciendo el tamaño de las matrices y haciendo más visible la estructura autoregresiva.\n",
        "\n",
        "- La menor cantidad de tokens permitió observar de manera más clara la función de cada cabeza, destacando las diagonales y los picos de atención sin el ruido visual que aparecía en secuencias largas.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Los cambios en la tokenización modificaron la distribución de los tokens, lo que a su vez produjo variaciones en cómo el modelo reparte la atención entre posiciones, aun sin alterar la arquitectura del transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Las cabezas muestran roles diferenciados de forma más evidente gracias a la escala reducida: algunas se concentran en dependencias locales, mientras que otras capturan relaciones más amplias.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Las generaciones resultantes mantienen coherencia, pero reflejan las diferencias en los tokens de entrada: secuencias más cortas y limpias producen salidas más directas y menos redundantes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- El comportamiento general del modelo se mantiene, pero los gráficos de esta versión permiten interpretarlo con mayor claridad gracias a la combinación de una tokenización distinta y un contexto de evaluación más reducido.\n",
        "\n",
        "- En conjunto, esta versión mejora la interpretabilidad del modelo sin modificar su arquitectura, evidenciando cómo el preprocesamiento y la longitud del input influyen directamente en la apariencia de los mapas de atención y en la dinámica de generación."
