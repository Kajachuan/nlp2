        "\n",
        "- Los mapas de atención muestran que el modelo aprendió correctamente el patrón autoregresivo: cada posición se concentra principalmente en tokens previos, con diagonales claras y atención decreciente hacia el pasado.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Las diferencias entre cabezas dentro de una misma capa reflejan que cada una captura relaciones distintas: algunas son más locales (atención muy cerca de la diagonal) mientras que otras muestran saltos intermedios o picos aislados.\n",
        "\n",
        "- La segunda capa presenta patrones de atención más dispersos que la primera, lo que indica que el modelo aprendió dependencias más globales en niveles superiores de procesamiento.\n",
        "\n",
        "- La presencia de picos de atención en posiciones específicas sugiere que ciertas cabezas desarrollaron roles funcionales, como rastrear inicios de palabras o repeticiones.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Las generaciones producidas muestran coherencia básica y continuidad, confirmando que el mecanismo de atención está funcionando y que el modelo internalizó la estructura secuencial del corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Al comparar generaciones con distintas configuraciones (greedy, temperature, top-k/top-p), se observa cómo la atención influye en la diversidad: métodos deterministas producen textos más repetitivos, mientras que sampling genera salidas más variadas y naturales.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Aunque los expertos del MoE tienen arquitecturas diferentes, los resultados muestran que el gating distribuye los tokens entre ellos de forma efectiva, contribuyendo a la diversidad de patrones de atención.\n",
        "\n",
        "- En conjunto, los gráficos y las generaciones evidencian que TinyGPT logra reproducir comportamientos característicos de un transformer real, incluso con una arquitectura reducida."
